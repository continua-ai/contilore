# Asset notes

This directory contains draft branding and storytelling visuals used in the
README.

- `brand/`: logo/mascot explorations (preferred: `happy-paths-mascot-ring-purple.png`)
- `marketing/`: concept illustrations for product narrative

Most PNGs were generated as concept art via Vertex AI image generation
(`gemini-2.5-flash-image`) using prompts focused on purple/indigo flat-vector
style.

These are draft assets for OSS presentation and may be replaced by hand-crafted
designs later.
